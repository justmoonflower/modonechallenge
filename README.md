## Description

The challenge was to take a website and code it with accessibility standards per the client's request.

## Project

Using VS Code, GitBash and GitHub, I was able to create a repository with the website's existing code to make sure it contains the requested criteria.

With VS Code, I could refactor it to improve the code without changing it.
